Project Description
This project was employed by combining both  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) algorithms with Blockchain technology.
In this project, We suggest using Blockchain technology to improve security and privacy in healthcare systems  for sharinf the Health Information Exchane of the patient in addition to data encryption.However, security concerns are solved by combining the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) algorithms with Blockchain to encrypt data and restrict access to it.
